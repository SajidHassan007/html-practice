Software is ubiquitious and every person can now build their way to a future that inspires them. However, <strong>today’s world isn’t designed to work for these makers</strong>  creating an imbalance between the impact they’re capable of, and what’s expected of them. </p>

            Currently, I am working as <strong>Head of Engineering</strong>  at <a href="https://sdui.de" target="_blank">Sdui</a>. It’s an amazing gig where I get to work alongside great developers on a software product that has become an integral medium upon which tens of thousands of teachers, parents and students rely to guarantee essential communication.

            I’m a huge physics nerd, in particular cosmology. I wrote about the accelerating expansion of the universe, or better know as Dark Energy <a href="posts/dark-energy">here</a>.

                I founded and built <a href="https://hackerbay.com/" target="_blank">Hackerbay</a> as CTO with three awesome friends. We took a small insight from hackathons – software is not a 12 month development cycle – and built up a B2B company. We worked with Twitter, Vodafone, Allianz and some of Germany’s <br>
                 largest corporations. With <a href="https://hackerbay.com/" target="_blank">NFX</a>  we had incredible investors on board and always an open ear from James, Pete, or Gigi.
             </p> 
    
             <p >
                After five years of immense personal and professional growth, priorities changed and we decided to pursue new opportunities, where each of our personal strengths are best put to use.
             </p> 
    
             <p >
                 For me that's <strong>building tools for enabling the next billion developers</strong>
